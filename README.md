## Summary

In this project, my research group and I investigated coping mechanisms for expectation violations in end-of-life communication among young adults. Through two experiments, we presented vignettes to 261 university students, manipulating the credibility and valence of expectation-disconfirming information. Using one-way and two-way ANOVAs in SPSS, we analyzed responses to identify predictors of coping strategies, focusing on immunization and accommodation outcomes.
